# CozmoCoaster

Take Cozmo on a joyride in the air and watch him have fun. The more you move him around, the more dizzy he gets. When you put him down, he will act dizzy according to his dizzy meter. The program uses Cozmo's accelerometer and gyroscope values for the experience.

# Dependencies
The modules required in addition to the `Cozmo` module are:

* numpy
* Pillow
* Common
* OpenCV

Common is a package included in the Git repo: https://github.com/Wizards-of-Coz/Common

I have used OpenCV3 with the project. You will need to install OpenCV following the instructions on their website.

The other modules can be installed via pip if not already present:
`pip3 install numpy`
`pip3 install Pillow`
